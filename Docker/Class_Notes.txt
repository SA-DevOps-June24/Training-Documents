Containerization using Docker :::


	DevOps :::
	
		Various Stages of DevOps ?
		
		Stages of DevOps :
		
			CI / CD 
			
			Continous Integration and Continous Delivery/Deployment
			
			Developer ::
			
				Dev Environment :
					Create Source Code 	# Local Machine using Eclipse IDE/Unit Test/Tomcat - Test the Application
						
						Build
						Create Artifacts(Binaries - *.war/*.jar/*.dll/*.exec)
						
						mywebapp.war_v1.0  	---> jdk11, tomcat9		

						Sign.java	==> Sign.war 	==> ---> jdk11, tomcat9	
						
						Signup.java	==> Signup.war 	==> ---> jdk8, tomcat8.5	
					
					Package ==> Signup.war ==> Application Image (Signup.war,jdk11, tomcat9) ==> signup_appimg1:v1.0
						
						Add the Image to Container Registry.
						
				Promote the artifacts to target enviroments 				
				
				
				QA(VM) 	--> mywebapp.war_v1.0	---> jdk11, tomcat9	
						Sign.war	==> 	---> jdk11, tomcat9	
						Signup.war 	==> 	---> jdk8, tomcat8.5	
				
				UAT --> mywebapp.war_v1.0	--> jdk11, tomcat9	
				
				PROD --> mywebapp.war_v1.0	--> jdk11, tomcat9		
				
				
				Monolith Application Architecture :::
				
				Micro-Service Based Application Architecture :::
				
					Application :	E_Commerce(www.amazon.com)
						service1		Sign.java
						service2		Signup.java 
						service3		payment.java


				Environments :
				
					DEV Server
					
					QA Server 
				

	Containerization using Docker ::
	
		Containerization ==> It is process of packaging the Application along with its dependencies. 
		
			Virual Machine ::
			
				- VMs are called as Hardware level Virtualization 
				- VMs are Created using Hypervisor 
				- VMs are used to run the Operating Systems
				- VMS consume more space and time to start
				- VMs Consume more resource, even if there is no application running.

			Container ::

				- Containers are called as OS Level Virtualization
					- Containers uses the underlying properties of OS(Kernel) like Namespace / Control Groups
				- Containers are Created using Container Engine 
				- Container are basically used to run the Task/Applications, NOT Operating System
					- If we try to run the Container without any Task/Application, Container will immediately goes to exit state
					- Container release the resources. It will never hold the resource with any task/application
				- Container consume less space and time to start

	
		Containerization ==> It is process of packaging the Application along with its dependencies. 
		
			Infra-Structure Perspective :::
			
				Jenkins_Master(VM) 		# Create Jenkins Jobs and schedule it to run in the slave nodes.
										Java,.net,python,nodejs,angular,ruby
				
					Jenkins_Slave1(VM)	# Used to perform actual build 	- Java build 
					Jenkins_Slave2(VM)	# Used to perform actual build	- Python
					Jenkins_Slave3(VM)	# Used to perform actual build	- NodeJS		
					Jenkins_Slave4(VM)	# Used to perform actual build	- Angular		
					Jenkins_Slave5(VM)	# Used to perform actual build	- .Net
					
					
				Containerization :::
				
					- It is used to reduce the number of VMs.					
					
					Jenkins_Master(VM) :
						Jenkins_Slave1(VM)
							Container-Engine
								C1 - Java build 
								C2 - Python
								C3 - NodeJS	
								C4 - Angular	
								C5 - .Net				
					
					
			Deployment Perspective ::	
				
				Containerization :::
				
					- It is used to prevent the compatibility issues of the tools in all the higher enviroments.
					- It is process of packaging the Application along with its dependencies. 

			Developer ::
			
				Dev Environment :
					Create Source Code 	# Local Machine using Eclipse IDE/Unit Test/Tomcat - Test the Application
						
						Build
						Create Artifacts(Binaries - *.war/*.jar/*.dll/*.exec)
						
						mywebapp.war_v1.0  	---> jdk11, tomcat9		
					
					Package ==> mywebapp.war_v1.0 ==> Application Image (mywebapp.war_v1.0, jdk11, tomcat9) ==> mywebapp_img:v1.0
						
						Publish the Application Image to Container Registry.
						
				Promote the artifacts to target enviroments 				
				
				
				QA(VM) 	-->
						mywebapp_img:v1.0			(mywebapp.war_v1.0,jdk11, tomcat9)
						Create Container out of this image and run the container.

				
				UAT --> mywebapp_img:v1.0			(mywebapp.war_v1.0,jdk11, tomcat9)
						Create Container out of this image and run the container.
				
				PROD --> mywebapp_img:v1.0			(mywebapp.war_v1.0,jdk11, tomcat9)
						 Create Container out of this image and run the container.
				
				
		
		Terminologies :::
		
			Container Image 	# Is a static file, that define the properties(application & its dependencies) of the container
								# Image are Non-Executable
								
			Container			# Executable units of Container Image
			
			Container Registry	# Is used to store/Manage the Container Images
								# DockerHub 
								
			Container Repository# It is sub-set of Container Registry
			
			Container Engine	# Is used create the Container Image, Container and Manage the Container
								# Docker Container Engine
		
		
		Docker Containers :::
		
		Managed Services ::
		
			AWS 		ECS, ECR, EKS
			
			AZURE		ACS, ACR, AKS 
			
			GCP 		GCE, GCR, GKE
			
		DevOps Tools :
		
			Open-Source DevOps Tools :
				git, jekins,docker,kubernetes,.....
			
			Managed Services
			
				Service Providers - Paid Service 
			
			
		Working with Docker ::
		
			Container Registry :
			
				Goto https://hub.docker.com/
				
				Create Account 
			Install Docker Container Engine :
			
				Jenkins Slave Node :::
				
				Launch a Virtual Machine on AWS Cloud Platform 
				
					Ubuntu 22.04 
					
					Install Docker Engine 			https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
					
					docker cli			# Is a command line utility to interact with Docker Engine and work with Images and Containers
					
					
					As a root user run this command:
					
						apt update -y
						apt install docker.io -y
						\
				
				docker --version
				
				
Next ::
		Docker CLI - Misc Command
